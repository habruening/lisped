In this video I will explain and demonstrate, why I am not a fan of Emacs and
what I see problematic with Emacs. At the end of this video I'll also give an
interesting viewpoint to current technologies and practices. This viewpoint for

I must clarify that all the points in this video can be configured. Emacs is
highly configurable. But I am not the user who wants to configure things. I
expect a program to be comfortable out of the box.

nothing is as one normally expects. Emacs greets you with a nice welcome screen,
which directly guides you to a tutorial. That may be good when starting Emacs
for the first time. But when you quickly want to scratch something, this is
annoying. You are forced to create a new file and even give it a file name. You
may not want this because you don't plan to save your scratchpad.

But now let's edit a few things.
